## Overview

For the challenge, I implemented a simple desktop based Giphy browser that includes

- An app header with basic navigation controls for showing the various pages, along with a search bar for searching Giphy
- Showing the currently trending gifs with basic pagination
- The ability to search from a search page or the app header and see the results with basic pagination
- The ability to save gif ids to indexedDB, these are displayed on the Saved page with pagination. Gifs can be saved / unsaved from any of the pages

## Implementation considerations

### Tech

The browser was built using a React + TS (SWC) template generated by Vite, the following third party libraries were used:

- MUI
- TanStack Router
- TanStack Query
- FramerMotion
- Dexie
- Sass
